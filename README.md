# Hi. I'm Sid ðŸ‘‹
## About me
I'm a student based in England, interested in design and development. I am the founder of Easy UI, a community for UI designers and frontend developers and co-founder/CTO at STEM Blog. I am also part of the team at cross.place.
## Things I use
I am a frontend developer and work with tools such as React, Next.js, Alpine.js, but also Tailwind CSS. I am also a UI designer, and use tools such as Figma, and Vectornator to make designs/mockups for my work.
